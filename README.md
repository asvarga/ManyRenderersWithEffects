ManyRenderersWithEffects
========================

An edit of this THREE.JS example of multiple renderers:
http://mrdoob.github.io/three.js/examples/webgl_multiple_views.html

I'm trying add anti-aliasing to it, using post-processing, like this example:
http://mrdoob.github.io/three.js/examples/webgl_postprocessing.html

I explain my main problem here:

Any edits to the original example are between "EDIT" and "END EDIT" comments.
